                    <h4>What is Ozone (O3)?</h4>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        Ozone is a chemical compound formed by 3 oxygen molecules. There are 2 “kinds" of Ozone. The “good” kind that exists high above the earth’s surface that protects us from harmful UV rays. The “bad” kind that forms near the earth’s surface that poses health risks. The “bad” Ozone forms as a chemical reaction near earth’s surface when man-made systems (industrial facilities, motor vehicles, etc) exhaust oxide of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in addition to sunlight. Ozone is considered a seasonal summer pollutant when sunlight is strongest and hot temperatures are ideal for ozone formation.

                        Ozone has directly linked to health problems including throat irritation, chest pain, coughing, and can aggravate asthma, bronchitis, reduced lung function, and emphysema.
